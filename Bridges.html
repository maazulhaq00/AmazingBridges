    <h3 class="ms-3">The Golden Gate Bridge</h3>

    <p class="ms-3 lead">
        The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California and U.S..
        It is arguably the most recognizable bridge in the world. It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern
        World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Frommers travel guide considers the Golden Gate Bridge
        “possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world”. It opened in 1937 and had
        until 1964 the longest suspension bridge main span in the world, at 4,200 feet (1,280 m).

    <h3 class="ms-3">The Sydney Harbour Bridge</h3>

        Nicknamed “The Coathanger” by Sydney locals because of its arch-based design. The dramatic view of the bridge,
        the harbour, and the nearby Sydney Opera House is an iconic image of Sydney, New South Wales, and Australia. The
        Bridge opened in 1932 and is a focal point of Aussie pride and celebrations. It is the sixth longest
        spanning-arch bridge in the world. It is the tallest steel arch and widest long-span bridge, at 48.8 meters (160
        feet) wide. Every year for New Years Eve the bridge itself is used to complement fireworks displays creating
        various effects like smiley faces and a disco ball.

        Referred as the ‘Blinking Eye Bridge’ or the ‘Winking Eye Bridge’ due to its shape and its tilting method. The
        Gateshead Millennium Bridge is the world’s first and currently only tilting bridge. But the most amazing thing
        about this pedestrian and biker crossing of the Tyne River is that it appears as if an eye is winking whenever
        it is raised and lowered. It was opened to the public on September 2001. Its innovative and unique design has
        won loads of awards since Queen Elizabeth officially opened it in 2002.

    <p class="ms-3 lead">
        A combined bascule and suspension bridge in London which crosses the River Thames. It is close to the Tower of
        London, from which it takes its name, and has become an iconic symbol of London. The Bridge was opened on June
        30, 1894  by Edward, Prince of Wales and Alexandra, Princess of Wales in 1894.

        Tower Bridge is a Grade I bridge in London, built between 1886 and 1894,
        designed by Horace Jones and engineered by John Wolfe Barry with the help of Henry Marc Brunel. It crosses
        the River Thames close to the Tower of London. The bridge was constructed to give better access to
        the East End of London, which had expanded its commercial potential in the 19th century.
       
        The bridge is 800 feet (240 m) in length and consists of two 213-foot (65 m) bridge towers connected at the
        upper level by two horizontal walkways, and a central pair of bascules that can open to allow shipping.
        Originally hydraulically powered, the operating mechanism was converted to an electro-hydraulic system in 1972.

    <h3 class="ms-3">The Nanpu Bridge</h3>

    <p class="ms-3 lead">
        The cable-stayed bridge was designed by the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute, Shanghai Urban
        Construction College, and Shanghai Urban Construction Design Institute, with assistance from Holger S. Svensson.
        Known for its funky and innovative spiral approach, Shanghai’s Nanpu Bridge designers came up with the novel
        idea to save space.
        It has a main span of 428 meters (1,388 ft), shorter than its sister bridge (Yangpu Bridge). It is the 57th
        longest cable-stayed
        bridge in the world, opened to the public in 1991.

        The Bosphorus Bridge, known officially as the 15 July Martyrs Bridge and colloquially as the First Bridge , is
        the southernmost of
        the three suspension bridges spanning the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul, Turkey, thus
        connecting Europe and Asia. The bridge extends between Ortaköy (in Europe) and Beylerbeyi (in Asia).

        It is a gravity-anchored suspension bridge with steel towers and inclined hangers.The aerodynamic deck hangs
        on steel cables. It is 1,560 m (5,118 ft) long with a deck width of 33.40 m (110 ft).[1] The distance between
        the towers (main span) is 1,074 m (3,524 ft) and the total height of the towers is 165 m (541 ft). The
        clearance of the bridge from sea level is 64 m (210 ft).
